> Mircrosoft Windows is unique in its underlying code.
> Apple's macOS is a fully-qualified UNIX distribution based on BSD Unix (an OS distributed until 1995).

> OS Decision Points:
	- Role
	- Function
	- Life Cycle
		-- Release Cycle: OS & software upgrades come on a periodic basis.
		-- Maintenance/Life Cycle: Vendors only support older versions of software for a certain period of time before not offering any updates.
	- Stability
	- Compatibility
	- Cost
	- Interface

> Linux Decision Points: 
	- Role
	- Function
	- Life Cycle
		-- Enthusiast: Eg:- openSUSE's Tumbleweed, Red Hat's Fedora, Ubuntu Desktop
		-- Enterprise: Eg:- Red Hat, Canonical & SUSE
	- Stability
		-- Features are added & changed in the Fedora release (beta) before finding their way into the enterprise-ready RedHat distribution.
		-- SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) is enterprise distribution from SUSE.
	- Cost 
	- Interface
		-- MOTD (Message of the day)

> Linux Distribution
	- Red Hat
		-- RPM (RedHat Package Manager)
		-- RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
		-- Fedora Project (Enthusiast version)
		-- CentOS, Scientific Linux
			--- Free to use
			--- Not paid support
	
	- SUSE
		-- Slackware -> SUSE
		-- openSUSE (free version)

	- Debian
		-- Ubuntu (created by Canonical)
		-- Linux Mint (froked from Ubuntu)

	- Android
		-- Dalvik VM

	- Rasbian 
		-- runs on Rasberry Pi hardware.	
	
	- LFS (Linux Frome Scratch)
