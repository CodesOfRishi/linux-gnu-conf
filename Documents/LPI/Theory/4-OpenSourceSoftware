> There are many different varients of open source, but all agree that users should have access to the source code. 
> Where they differ is in how one can, or must, redistribute changes.

> 3 distinct components, when buying a software:
	- Ownership - Who owns the intellectual property behind the software?
	- Money Transfer - How does money change hands, if at all?
	- Licensing - What do you get? What can you do with the software? Can you use it on only one computer? Can you give it to someone else?

> Microsoft Windows
	- EULA
 > Linux 
 	- Owned by Linux Torvalds
	- GPLv2
		-- The source code must be available to anyone who asks & that anyone is allowed to make changes.
		-- If someone makes changes & distributes them, they must put the changes under the same license.
		-- No one is allowed to price the source code.

> Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)
	- The right, "to decide how to use & distribute the software" is given up.

> Groups:

		-- Founded by Richard Stallman 
		-- Copyleft:
			--- If someone modifies free software, they should be required to share any changes they have made when they share it again.

		-- LGPLv2 (GNU Lesser General Public License)
