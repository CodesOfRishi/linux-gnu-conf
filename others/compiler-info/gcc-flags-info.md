- **`-Wall`**
  - Recommended compiler warnings.
  - [Reference](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html)
- **`-Wextra`**
  - This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by `-Wall`.

- **`-Wshadow`**
  - Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable, parameter, type, class member (in C++), or whenever a built-in function is shadowed. 
  - Note that in C++, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum. 
  - If this warning is enabled, it includes also all instances of local shadowing. This means that `-Wno-shadow=local` and `-Wno-shadow=compatible-local` are ignored when `-Wshadow` is used. Same as `-Wshadow=global`.

- **`-O2`**
  - More optimization than `-O1`.
  - GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
  - As compared to `-O`, this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.
  - `-O2` turns on all optimization flags specified by `-O`.

- **`-fwrapv`**
  - This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation.

- **`-Wfloat-equal`**
  - Warns if two floating point values are compared directly: `a == b`. Usually the correct way is: `abs(a - b) < EPS`.
  - [Reference](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/15547)
- **`-Wconversion`**
  - Warns if data can be lost in an *implicit* conversion. Most often it is accidental assignment of a `long long` value to an `int` variable.
